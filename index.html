                <h1>DK RAP</h1>
                <p>SO THEY'RE FINALLY BACK, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
                    THEY'RE BRINGING YOU A BRAND NEW RHYME
                    YOU LOVED THEM ALL IN DK 64
                    AND I BET YOU'RE WONDERIN' WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
                    HUH! DK! DONKEY KONG!
                    
                    HE'S THE LEADER OF THE BUNCH, YOU KNOW HIS NAME, BUT BEHIND THE SCENES, HE'S NOT THE SAME
                    AFTER DK 64, HE GOT INTO GUNS
                    NOW HE HUNTS ENDANGERED SPECIES JUST FOR FUN
                    BUT HIS COCONUT GUN STILL FIRES IN SPURTS
                    IF HE SHOOTS YA... YOU'LL PROBABLY DIE
                    
                    HE'S OLDER, MEANER, AND WEALTHIER TOO
                    HE'S THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE DK CREW
                    HUH! DK! HE LOVES GUNS!
                    
                    TINY KONG'S BACK, SO LISTEN UP DUDES
                    SHE CAN SHRINK IN SIZE TO SUIT HER MOOD
                    NOW YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT THE BEES ARE DYING
                    WELL THE TRUTH ABOUT TINY IS HORRIFYING!
                    
                    SHE'S KILLING ALL THE BEES!
                    SHE'S KILLING ALL THE BEES!
                    WE DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT SHE'S KILLING ALL THE BEES
                    SHE CAN FLOAT THROUGH THE AIR AND CLIMB UP TREES
                    BUT TINY KONG'S A MURDERER
                    OF BEES!
                    DK! GOODBYE BEES.
                    
                    HE HAS A FUNNY FACE, HIS LIMBS ARE LONG
                    BUT LANKY NEVER FELT LIKE HE BELONGED
                    HE EARNED A DEGREE IN A COLLEGE TOWN
                    AND DECIDED TO WORK AS A SEX ED CLOWN
                    NOW HE HAS A PENIS PUPPET,
                    AND A VULVA PUPPET TOO
                    AND HE'LL GIVE A CREEPY LECTURE
                    JUST FOR YOU
                    (JUST FOR YOU)
                    
                    AND NEXT UP DIDDY KONG HITS THE STAGE
                    JUST LIKE GARY COLEMAN, HE DOES NOT AGE
                    HIS FACE IS YOUTHFUL LIKE PETER PAN'S
                    BUT HE'S A BITTER OLD BASTARD WHO HATES HIS FANS
                    HE'S ANGRY! HORNY! LIBIDO'S WILD!
                    BUT WOMEN WON'T DATE HIM 'CAUSE HE LOOKS LIKE A CHILD
                    THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN HIS JOB WHICH YOU WON'T FORGET
                    HE BLOGS FOR DIDDYPEPETRUMPMRA.NET
                    HUH! DK! HE NEEDS LOVE!
                    
                    AND THEN THERE'S CHUNKY
                    HE'S DEAD
